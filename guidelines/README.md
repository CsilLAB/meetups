### Details

So maybe you've done something cool, have a story to tell, maybe you've got an interesting problem, or you've solved an interesting problem and would like to talk about it. That's great! We'd love to hear from you!
Everyone is encouraged to submit a proposal regardless of experience. Talks in the past have ranged from introductory, to advanced. If you're reading this and are interested in speaking at the London Network Automation Meetup then we want you to submit a proposal!

Before you start, there are some factual things you should know.
- There are two types of presentation we take. A "My Project" talk which usually focuses on a problem you've solved including a demo, and a more traditional "Presentation" format.
- Presentations are usually 30 minutes long including time for questions. If for some reason yours is going to take longer then let us know and we'll see what we can do.
- You can include a demo in a Presentation if you'd like.
- "My Project" Demos are usually 15 minutes long. If you need more time then let us know beforeahand and we'll see what we can do.
- We usually finalise the schedule of presentations 2 weeks before the meetup. So if you want to speak at the next meetup, then try and let us know 2 weeks in advance.

Here are some questions people usually struggle with when they submit a proposal:
- Are people interested in hearing about this?
  We have a varied audience according to the feedback we get. Wherever you are on the spectrum, trust us, you'll have someone interested in what you're saying.
  Recent articles, blog posts, tweets, and open source projects from the community can be a good source of talk topics and ideas, as can your own experience as an engineer/developer/manager/person.
- What would people be interested in hearing?
  Where do we start! People are interested in varied things from your journey as a person to statistical analysis using Pandas. Like we've said, the spectrum is vast!
- I've never done this before, do you have any advice for me?
  The most obvious thing to do is to practice your presentation. You honestly cannot do this enough. If there's anything else you're worried about then get in touch and we'll help.

With the above in mind, there are some *Good Ideas* to be mindful of:
- Submit your proposal early. The sooner you do this, the more time we will have to feedback and help you out. Things get pretty hectic in the final 10 days of organising the meetup and we all have day jobs, so it makes sense to get it in early.
- Answer some basic questions:
  - Who is the intended audience? Try and be specific. For example, Network Engineers is a broad subset, but Network Engineers who are trying to automate data collection is probably a good target to start with.
  - What will attendees get out of it? When they leave the room, what will they know that they didn't know before?
- If you're not submitting a fully fledged proposal, then try and submit an enumeration of what you intend to say and time estimates.
  - You don't need to have written it already, but have an idea of the points you want to make and how long it makes sense to talk about each one.
- Include links to source code, blog posts, articles and other things that will add context to your talk.
- Please feel free to thank our sponsors. Without them this wouldn't be possible!
- Finally, if you want people to get in touch after your talk then let them know how to reach you. e.g: E-mail, Twitter, LinkedIn etc.

With the good, there is always the bad. Bad ideas include:
- Sales pitches/informercials.
  - Feel free to talk about where you work. However, talks along the lines of "how to operate our product" is probably not a great idea.
- How to operate your product. For example, I don't think anyone is interested in how to configure feature X on device Y. But an explanation of the internals should be fine.

If you're not sure, you can always ask!

## Panelists
Ideally we'd like to spend a short amount of time talking to you before the panel. This is to get to know you and find out what your strengths are. This allows us to direct questions to the best person on the panel. We know you're busy so this is not always possible. If you could make time for a phone/Skype/FaceTime chat then that works fine too.
Be prepared to introduce yourself to the audience. What should they know about you? What are you bringing to the discussion?
In the interests of time we may not call upon you to answer a question. However, if you have a burning opinion on something and want to voice it during the panel then we'll figure something out.
Also, opinionated folk tend to make for interesting discussions. However, remember, there's a human on the other side of the question!

## Sponsors
Sponsors get to announce their company, publicity via the meetup group, and an announcement from the compere during it.
We have a few sponsorship options.
- **Social sponsorship**
  We'd like to do informal event focusing on the social aspects, where people with network automation interest can connect, grab a drink and share their motivation and experience. A venue for this type of event can be a pub or an office space. We'd like companies to sponsor and provide drinks and potentially foor or snacks. We're happy to announce the meeting using the Meetup group. It's then up to you to figure out what you want from it. Let's discuss.
- **Venue sponsorship**
  We're always on the lookout for new venues. If you've got something that can host a 100 people comfortably including food and drink, then we'd love to hear from you.
- **Video recording sponsorship**
  You need to organise recording the event and editing the footage. You will need to supply the video files within a week of the event.

## Attendees
We'll usually wine and dine you which is not a bad deal for an evening of your time where you can learn and see some cool things!
With this in mind, please be mindful of the following:
- Please be curious and ask questions!
- Be considerate of the other attendees. You're at this event because you're a professional. If it's something that won't fly in your workplace, then chances are it won't here either.
That's it!
